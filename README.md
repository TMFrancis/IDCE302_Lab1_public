Description: The following code defines a function, runoff(), that accepts arguments for a land plot in feet (width and length) and total percipitation in inches. It will return the inputs as well as total rain runoff in gallons. It is assumed that the plot of land is impervious; runoff is equivalent to 100% of rainfall on plot and there is no runoff from abutting plots.<br><br>
Usage: runoff(plot_width,plot_length,rainfall_inches) where plot_width is the plot width in feet, plot_length is plot length in feet, and rainfall_inches is rainfall in inches.
