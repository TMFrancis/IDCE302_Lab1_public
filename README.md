# Lab 1 â€“ Calculations with Python

Name: Tom Francis<br>
Class: IDCE 302<br>
Date: 10 September 2020<br>
Python Version: CoLab Python Py 3.6.7.<br><br>
Description: The following code defines a function, runoff(), that accepts arguments for a land plot in feet (width and length) and total percipitation in inches. It will return the inputs as well as total rain runoff in gallons. It is assumed that the plot of land is impervious; runoff is equivalent to 100% of rainfall on plot and there is no runoff from abutting plots.<br><br>
Issues: I found the programming very straightforward, but failed to adequately test and did not use the total percipitation input in my calculations. The second version incorporates total percipitation based on Shashank Gupta's comments. The challenging part for me is GitHub. I didn't immediately grasp that the assignment was a private repository that I would edit and populate. I had trouble moving the code that I had created in a CoLab notebook into the private repository.<br><br>
Usage: runoff(plot_width,plot_length,rainfall_inches) where plot_width is the plot width in feet, plot_length is plot length in feet, and rainfall_inches is rainfall in inches.
